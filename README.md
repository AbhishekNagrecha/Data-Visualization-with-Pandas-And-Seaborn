# Data-Visualization-with-Pandas-And-Seaborn
Here I will investigate methods for the exploration of data using visualization techniques by using several Python packages to create the visualizations, matplotlib, Pandas plotting, and seaborn.
For this I will be working with a data set containing the prices and characteristics of a number of automobiles. 
The ultimate goal is to build a model for predicting the price of a car from its characteristics.
Explored Scatter plots with different asthetics including marker-size, marker-shape and color.Used seaborn package for plots like KDE and Violin.
