# Data-Visualization-with-Pandas-And-Seaborn
Here I investigated different data visualization techniques by using several Python packages to create the visualizations like matplotlib, Pandas plotting, and seaborn.
For this I will be working with a data set containing the prices and characteristics of a number of automobiles. 
Explored Scatter plots with different asthetics including marker-size, marker-shape and color.Used seaborn package for plots like KDE and Violin with multiple splits.
For bar graphs and histograms varied the bin size & also tried seaborn for box-plots. Used Multi-axix and facet plts with multiple features.
The primary goal was to show the true power of data visualization in exploratory data analysis and building predictive models
